A fictional video rental company wanted insights on where their customer base was located and how they could use transaction data to transition to online streaming.

I investigated top countries, genres, and customers by rental counts and revenue. Through this, I discovered that there was more revenue coming in than the films cost to rent. Upon further review, it appears these are late fees for customers keeping rentals past their allotted time.
